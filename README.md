## Introduction

The SSOL staking contract is a Solana program that enables users to stake SSOL tokens and earn rewards. It was developed as a conversion from the original SSOL token program, with a focus on security, efficiency, and user experience.

## Architecture

### Program Structure

```
src/
├── lib.rs              # Main program entry point
├── error.rs            # Custom error definitions
├── instruction.rs      # Program instructions
├── processor.rs        # Business logic implementation
└── state.rs           # State management
```

### Key Components

1. **State Management**

   - `StakeAccount`: Stores user staking information
   - `StakePool`: Manages global staking pool state
   - `StakeConfig`: Contains staking parameters

2. **Instructions**
   - `Initialize`: Sets up the staking program
   - `Stake`: Allows users to stake tokens
   - `Unstake`: Enables users to withdraw staked tokens
   - `ClaimRewards`: Distributes staking rewards
   - `UpdateConfig`: Modifies staking parameters

## Features

### 1. Staking

- Users can stake SSOL tokens
- Minimum stake amount: 1 SSOL
- Staking period: 7 days minimum
- Rewards accrue daily

### 2. Rewards

- Daily reward rate: 0.1% (configurable)
- Rewards are distributed proportionally
- Automatic reward calculation
- Claimable at any time

### 3. Unstaking

- 7-day cooldown period
- Partial unstaking supported
- Automatic reward distribution on unstake

### 4. Administration

- Configurable parameters
- Emergency pause functionality
- Reward rate adjustments
- Pool size management

## Implementation Details

### State Management

```rust
pub struct StakeAccount {
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub start_time: i64,
    pub last_claim_time: i64,
    pub rewards_claimed: u64,
}

pub struct StakePool {
    pub total_staked: u64,
    pub total_rewards: u64,
    pub reward_rate: u64,
    pub last_update_time: i64,
    pub is_paused: bool,
}
```

### Key Functions

1. **Staking**

   - Validates stake amount
   - Creates stake account
   - Transfers tokens
   - Updates pool state

2. **Reward Calculation**

   - Time-based accrual
   - Proportional distribution
   - Automatic updates

3. **Unstaking**
   - Cooldown validation
   - Partial withdrawal support
   - Reward distribution

## Optimizations

### 1. Gas Efficiency

- Minimal state updates
- Optimized calculations
- Efficient storage usage

### 2. Security

- Comprehensive validation
- Access control
- Emergency controls

### 3. User Experience

- Simple interface
- Clear error messages
- Flexible operations

## Testing

### Test Coverage

1. **Unit Tests**

   - State management
   - Calculations
   - Validation logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end flows
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling

### Test Cases

1. Basic staking/unstaking
2. Reward calculation
3. Partial unstaking
4. Emergency scenarios
5. Configuration updates

## Future Considerations

### 1. Planned Improvements

- Tiered reward system
- Lock-up periods
- Governance integration

### 2. Potential Features

- Staking pools
- Cross-program integration
- Advanced analytics

### 3. Maintenance

- Regular audits
- Performance monitoring
- Community feedback

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Development (2 days)

- Program structure setup
- Basic functionality implementation
- Initial testing

### Phase 2: Optimization (1 day)

- Gas optimization
- Security improvements
- Code refactoring

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (1 day)

- Comprehensive testing
